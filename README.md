### Status

I will hopefully take this project beyond what is outlined in the guide that it's based on.

Huge props to Patryk Wycowaniec for creating such a great tutorial series.

### Things I might try

- Focus on adding algorithms for the genetic algorithm i.e. selection, crossover and mutation.
- Improve UI, in fact at the time of writing, add a UI
- Commands can be replaced with ui buttons
- Experiment in 3d, give that a UI
- Simulate unnecessarily more dimensions maybe someone would want that
- OR abandon it completely (dont)

### Development

Start locally using

`cd frontend && pnpm start`
